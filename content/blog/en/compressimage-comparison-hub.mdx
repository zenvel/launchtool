## Why this hub exists

We are building a full comparison series to help teams choose the right optimisation stack. Each article follows the same framework—positioning, performance benchmarks, workflow/automation, pricing, and clear “when to choose which” guidance.

Use this index to jump straight to the competitor you are researching or track what’s coming next.
