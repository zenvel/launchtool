## TL;DR

| Question | CompressImage | TinyPNG |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Processing model | 100% local in-browser or PWA, no uploads | Upload to TinyPNG servers; monthly quota unless paid |
| Batch workflow | Unlimited queue, per-file presets, CLI/API (beta) | 20 images/batch, 5 MB limit on free tier |
| Formats | JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, GIF (lossy/lossless) | JPEG, PNG (WebP via Pro) |
| Automation | WordPress integration (planned), CLI/Action preview, JSON reports | WordPress plugin, Shopify app |
| Collaboration | Shared presets, compression logs, download bundles | Single-user focus |

If you only need to shrink a handful of PNG logos quickly, TinyPNG is still excellent. For privacy-sensitive assets, high-volume workflows, or teams that need repeatable presets, CompressImage is the safer long-term bet.

## 1. Positioning & Core Differences

TinyPNG popularised drag-and-drop web compression and still excels at “quick shrink and download”. It shines for occasional JPG/PNG optimisations and has a polished WordPress plugin.

CompressImage began as an in-browser compressor built for design and growth teams that cannot upload unreleased assets to third-party servers. Everything happens locally; metadata never leaves the device. On top of that foundation we are layering repeatable presets, structured reports, and automation hooks.

### Feature Snapshot

| Capability | CompressImage | TinyPNG |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Processing location | Browser (WebAssembly, no upload) | Remote servers (EU/US data centres) |
| Batch size | Unlimited queue, per-file overrides | 20 images/batch; 100 images/month on free tier |
| Privacy | Files never leave your machine | Files stored temporarily on TinyPNG servers |
| Advanced formats | WebP & AVIF (lossy/lossless), GIF optimisation | WebP (Pro), no AVIF |
| Automation | JSON export, CLI beta, GitHub Action beta | WordPress & Shopify plugins, Zapier via API |
| Reporting | Compression log, before/after preview, download report | Download summary email (Pro) |

## 2. Performance Benchmarks

We compressed three representative assets with default recommended settings (CompressImage 75 quality / AUTO format, TinyPNG default smart compression). Tests were run on macOS Sonoma, Chrome 127.

| Test Asset | Original | CompressImage | TinyPNG | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 MB product photo (JPEG) | 4.02 MB | **1.05 MB** (-74%) | 1.18 MB (-71%) | Comparable quality; CompressImage kept EXIF off by default |
| 1.3 MB UI screenshot (PNG) | 1.31 MB | **340 KB** (-74%) | 402 KB (-69%) | TinyPNG introduced slight text haloing at default level |
| 820 KB hero illustration (PNG + transparency) | 823 KB | 212 KB (-74%) | **196 KB** (-76%) | TinyPNG slightly smaller; CompressImage preserved vector gradients better |

### Preview Check

CompressImage ships an interactive before/after slider so designers can catch gradient banding or brand colour shifts immediately. TinyPNG requires downloading the file first and comparing locally.

## 3. Workflow & Automation

| Workflow Need | CompressImage | TinyPNG |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Preset management** | Save quality/format presets, clone across projects | No |
| **Team collaboration** | Shareable logs (CSV/JSON), annotate compression notes | No native collaboration |
| **Continuous delivery** | CLI beta (`compressimage-cli`) + GitHub Action to precompress assets in PRs | API + Zapier for Pro customers |
| **CMS integration** | Headless export bundle, WordPress plugin (Q4 roadmap) | Mature WordPress & Craft CMS plugins |
| **Offline capability** | Installable PWA + upcoming desktop shell | Requires internet |

If your process involves designers handing off assets to developers, CompressImage’s logs and consistent presets prevent surprises. TinyPNG’s plugins may still be attractive for pure WordPress users, but anything beyond that often means juggling uploads manually.

## 4. Pricing & Limits

| Plan | CompressImage | TinyPNG |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | Unlimited images, full local features | 20 images/batch, max 5 MB each; 500 compressions/month (account) |
| Teams | Planned $9+/seat for shared presets, analytics, automation | Pro plans from $25/year (500 compressions) to $399/year (5,000 compressions) |
| Enterprise | Custom automation, dedicated support | API bundles from $85/year |

Because CompressImage does not incur server costs for compression itself, the free tier stays generous. Paid tiers revolve around collaboration, reporting, and automation rather than raw image quotas.

## 5. When to Choose Which

- **Pick CompressImage if you…**
  - handle confidential product shots or campaign assets before launch
  - compress large batches or need unlimited queues
  - want automated reports (CSV/JSON) for QA or stakeholders
  - plan to integrate compression into CI/CD or design system tooling

- **Pick TinyPNG if you…**
  - are a solo blogger needing quick, occasional PNG/JPEG optimisation
  - rely on WordPress/Shopify plugins today and do not mind uploads
  - prefer TinyPNG’s API for existing automation workflows

## 6. Getting Started with CompressImage

1. **Open the web app** (install the PWA if you prefer a desktop-like experience).  
2. **Drag in your test images**—everything stays local.  
3. **Adjust the quality slider or format override**; use the slider preview to validate brand-critical details.  
4. **Download the bundle** (original + optimised + JSON log).  
5. **Invite teammates** (coming soon) or export logs for design QA.
