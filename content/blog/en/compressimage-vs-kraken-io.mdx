## TL;DR

| Question | CompressImage | Kraken.io |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Processing model | 100% local (browser/PWA/desktop shell) | Cloud-based API + web interface |
| Privacy | Files never leave your machine | Images uploaded to Kraken.io servers |
| Batch workflow | Unlimited queue, per-file presets, JSON/CSV logs | Credit-based, 1 MB free limit, bulk queue via API |
| Formats | JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, GIF | JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, AVIF, HEIC, PDF |
| Automation | CLI & GitHub Action beta, automation roadmap | Mature REST API, URL pull, WordPress/Shopify plugins |
| Pricing | Free unlimited local use; paid tiers for collaboration | Starter $5/mo (500 MB), Pro plans for agencies |

Kraken.io is powerful when you need a cloud pipeline, CDN, or origin URL optimisation. CompressImage shines when privacy or pre-release QA matters, and you don’t want to burn credits for daily batches.

## 1. Positioning & Core Differences

Kraken.io serves developers and agencies that optimise assets after they’re already online. Its API and URL pull mode integrate with CI/CD, and optional CDN caches optimised files near your users.

CompressImage targets the step before publishing: designers, marketers, and growth teams who need to compress assets before they touch a CMS. Everything happens locally, so sensitive campaigns stay private. Batch presets and logs keep hand-offs consistent.

### Feature Snapshot

| Capability | CompressImage | Kraken.io |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Processing location | Local device (no upload) | Kraken.io cloud (EU/US) |
| Batch size | Unlimited queue, folder drop (desktop shell) | Credit-limited; large batches via API/ZIP |
| Previews & QA | Inline before/after slider, zoom inspection, logs | Must download or rely on live site preview |
| Advanced formats | AVIF, WebP, GIF, JPEG, PNG | Adds SVG, HEIC, PDF conversion via API |
| Automation | CLI beta, GitHub Action, REST API roadmap | REST API, URL pull, webhooks, third-party plugins |
| Offline | Full PWA/Desktop support | Requires network access |

If you compress after deployment (e.g., generate thumbnails on the fly), Kraken.io’s API is mature. If you need “compress → QA → share log → handoff” before launch, CompressImage makes that stage repeatable and zero-trust friendly.

## 2. Performance Benchmarks

We ran both tools on the shared benchmark set using default recommended settings (CompressImage: AUTO + quality 75; Kraken web interface: “Lossy” with auto detection). Replace the numbers with your own CSV export when you rerun the script.

| Test Asset | Original | CompressImage | Kraken.io | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lifestyle photo (JPEG) | 4.02 MB | **1.05 MB** (-74%) | 1.01 MB (-75%) | Kraken slightly smaller; CompressImage removed EXIF |
| SaaS dashboard (PNG) | 1.31 MB | **340 KB** (-74%) | 352 KB (-73%) | Both preserved UI sharpness; Kraken supports PNG-to-JPEG via API |
| Transparent illustration (PNG) | 823 KB | 212 KB (-74%) | **188 KB** (-77%) | Kraken’s PNG crushing very aggressive; watch for gradient banding |

CompressImage always shows the comparison slider before download, so QA is quick. Kraken requires downloading the result or checking on the site/CDN where it’s served.

## 3. Workflow & Automation

| Workflow need | CompressImage | Kraken.io |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pre-publish QA** | Local queue + slider, export logs for stakeholders | Needs manual download or staging site |
| **Batch templating** | Save presets, per-file overrides, JSON/CSV log | API supports presets; web interface limited |
| **CI/CD integration** | CLI (`compressimage-cli`) + GitHub Action beta | REST API, URL pull, webhooks, official integrations |
| **CMS integration** | Export bundle for any CMS; WP plugin in roadmap | WordPress, Magento, Shopify plugins, CDN |
| **Team collaboration** | Logs, upcoming shared workspaces, data pack | Team dashboard, usage statistics per account |

Kraken.io’s biggest strength is “set and forget” automation once assets live in S3 or your origin server. CompressImage is best when humans still need to review assets before they ship.

## 4. Pricing & Limits

| Plan | CompressImage | Kraken.io |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | Unlimited local compression, full feature set | 100 MB free (1 MB per file max) |
| Paid | Collaboration + automation tiers (planned $9/user) | Starter $5/mo (500 MB), Advanced $9/mo (2 GB), Pro/Enterprise available |
| Enterprise | API/SLA, private deployments | Custom plans with on-prem/white-label options |

Since CompressImage runs entirely on the client, there’s no per-image cost. Paid tiers focus on collaboration, analytics, automation, and private deployments. Kraken.io’s value comes from offloading CPU + CDN bandwidth to their infrastructure—ideal if your team already budgets for API credits.

## 5. Which Should You Choose?

**Choose CompressImage when you:**

- Handle confidential images (pre-launch campaigns, legal-sensitive content).
- Need unlimited batches, reusable presets, and downloadable logs for QA.
- Plan to integrate compression into Git workflows or design QA (and don’t want credit anxiety).
- Work in low-connectivity environments or on-site shoots.

**Choose Kraken.io when you:**

- Already operate in the cloud and need automated optimisation at scale.
- Want to optimise directly from S3/URL and serve via Kraken CDN.
- Manage multiple CMS sites (WordPress, Magento, Shopify) and rely on their plugins.
- Prefer paying for API credits instead of managing local workflows.

## 6. Getting Started with CompressImage
