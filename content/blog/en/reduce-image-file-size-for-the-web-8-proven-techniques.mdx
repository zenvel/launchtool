faqs:
  - question: "What’s the fastest way to cut image size in half?"
    answer: "Start by resizing to the display dimensions—this alone often saves 40–60%. Follow with WebP/AVIF compression and you’ll hit 70%+ reductions."
    href: "/blog/how-to-compress-an-image-without-losing-quality"
  - question: "Should I automate or compress manually?"
    answer: "Manual tools like CompressImage are great for short bursts. Once volume grows, integrate Sharp/Imagemin in CI or set up a local automation script."

  - question: "How do I keep SEO signals intact after compression?"
    answer: "Retain descriptive filenames, alt text, and ensure structured data references the optimized URLs. Compression itself doesn’t hurt SEO—slow load times do."

Need to make your pages lighter fast? These eight techniques are battle-tested across marketing sites, SaaS dashboards, and content-heavy publications. Combine them for compounding gains.

## 1. Resize before you compress

Export images at the maximum size they’ll ever appear—1600px for hero banners, 800px for inline visuals, 400px for thumbnails. Shrinking a 5000px photo down removes millions of unnecessary pixels before compression even begins.

## 2. Convert to modern codecs

- **Photos / gradients** → WebP, AVIF
- **UI + transparency** → PNG or WebP lossless
- **Icons** → SVG or WebP

Tools: use Photoshop export presets, or drop assets into CompressImage/Squoosh to convert instantly.

## 3. Use smart quality presets

- WebP/JPEG at quality 70–80 hits the sweet spot.
- AVIF CRF 40–45 provides dramatic savings with excellent fidelity.
- Record the presets you choose so teammates can replicate them.

## 4. Strip bloaty metadata

EXIF and color profiles can add tens of kilobytes. CompressImage, Squoosh, or ImageOptim can remove GPS data, camera settings, and thumbnails automatically—keep metadata only when you truly need it.

## 5. Lean on client-side compressors

Browser-based tools are fast, private, and accurate because they let you preview artifacts immediately.

- **CompressImage**: batch drag-and-drop, before/after slider, supports WebP/AVIF/JPEG/PNG.
- **Squoosh**: granular controls and experimental codecs for single images.

## 6. Serve responsive sources

Use `<picture>` and `srcset` so mobile devices aren’t forced to download desktop-sized assets.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="blog-hero.avif 1600w, blog-hero@2x.avif 2000w" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="blog-hero.webp 1600w, blog-hero@2x.webp 2000w" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="blog-hero.jpg" width="1600" height="900" loading="lazy" alt="Hero" />
</picture>
```

## 7. Lazy load everything below the fold

Add `loading="lazy"` to `<img>` tags or use Intersection Observer for background images. Pair with blurred placeholders or solid-color previews to keep layout shifts minimal.

## 8. Automate repeat work

When image volume increases:

- Use Sharp/Imagemin/Libvips scripts in your build pipeline.
- Integrate with your CMS: when new assets are added, trigger a worker that runs CompressImage in headless mode.
- Monitor bandwidth savings and Core Web Vitals to prove ROI.

## Bonus: don’t forget caching & CDN configuration

- Host optimized images on a CDN with `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000`.
- Use versioned filenames (e.g., `hero.v2.webp`) so browsers detect updates.
- Enable Brotli/Gzip for SVG and JSON sprite sheets.

## Quick audit checklist

- [ ] All hero images ≤ 250 KB (desktop) / 150 KB (mobile)
- [ ] Inline illustrations ≤ 100 KB
- [ ] AVIF/WebP served with JPEG fallbacks
- [ ] `loading="lazy"` added to offscreen images
- [ ] Lighthouse “Serve images in next-gen formats” audit passes
- [ ] Structured data references the optimized URLs

## Tools we trust

- [CompressImage](https://www.compressimage.dev/) — privacy-first, unlimited browser compressor.
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) — codec playground for pixel-perfect tuning.
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) — macOS batch metadata stripper + optimizer.
- [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) — Node.js powerhouse for automated pipelines.

## Wrap-up

Reducing image file size isn’t about a single magic switch. Stack these techniques—resize, convert, compress, deliver responsively—and your pages will stay fast even as visuals improve. Start with your heaviest page today and run through the checklist above; the savings are immediate.
