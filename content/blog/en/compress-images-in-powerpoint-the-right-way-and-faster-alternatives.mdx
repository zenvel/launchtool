faqs:
  - question: "Where is the Compress Pictures button in PowerPoint?"
    answer: "Select any image, go to Picture Format → Compress Pictures. Uncheck ‘Apply only to this picture’ if you want to compress the entire deck."
  - question: "What resolution should I choose?"
    answer: "For presentations shown on standard projectors, ‘Web (150 ppi)’ strikes the balance between clarity and size. Use ‘HD (330 ppi)’ when presenting on large 4K displays."
  - question: "How do I keep cropping edits from bloating the file?"
    answer: "In the Compress Pictures dialog, tick ‘Delete cropped areas of pictures’. Otherwise hidden pixels remain embedded and the deck stays large."

PowerPoint decks balloon fast once you drag in high-resolution imagery. Microsoft ships a “Compress Pictures” button, but the default settings can blur slides—or barely shrink anything. Here’s how to use it properly and when to switch to faster, higher-quality alternatives.

## Part 1: Use PowerPoint’s built-in compression

1. **Open your deck and select an image.** Any image works; the settings can apply to all slides.
2. Navigate to **Picture Format → Compress Pictures**.
3. In the dialog:
   - **Uncheck “Apply only to this picture”** if you want to compress every image in the file.
   - **Check “Delete cropped areas of pictures.”** This removes hidden pixels left over after cropping.
   - Choose a **target resolution**:
     | Resolution | When to use |
     | --- | --- |
     | **Web (150 ppi)** | Best balance for on-screen presentations and online sharing |
     | **Print (220 ppi)** | When you’ll print handouts |
     | **HD (330 ppi)** | Large venues with 4K displays |
     | **Use source** | Skip compression (not recommended for large decks) |
4. Click **OK**, save the file, and note the new size.

### Quick win checklist

- Remove unused master slides and hidden images.
- Avoid pasting images straight from the clipboard—use Insert → Picture so PowerPoint doesn’t embed full-resolution copies.
- Convert SmartArt or text-heavy screenshots into vector shapes when possible.

## Part 2: Faster alternatives for bulk image prep

PowerPoint’s compressor works, but it’s slow when you handle new assets each week. Instead, compress images **before** importing them into the deck.

### CompressImage (recommended)

1. Visit [CompressImage](https://www.compressimage.dev/).
2. Drag in the photos you plan to add to the deck.
3. Choose `AUTO` or set WebP/AVIF/JPEG manually.
4. Adjust quality (try 75 for WebP/JPEG) while using the before/after slider to ensure text and gradients stay sharp.
5. Download the optimized images; then insert them into PowerPoint. The deck stays lean from the start.

### Squoosh for pixel-perfect tweaking

If you must preserve every gradient, load the asset into [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/). Tweak chroma subsampling or MozJPEG settings, export lossless PNGs for logos, then bring them into the deck.

### Automate recurring decks

- Maintain a shared folder of pre-compressed assets for your team.
- Use a PowerShell or AppleScript to bulk replace images in templates with their compressed versions.
- Store decks in OneDrive or SharePoint to retain version history after optimization.

## Part 3: Additional tips to keep presentations small

- **Use vector icons**: leverage PowerPoint’s built-in icons or import SVGs.
- **Embed fonts sparingly**: embedding custom fonts adds weight; embed only subset characters if necessary.
- **Export slides as images** only for specific needs—doing so bloats deck size.
- **Regularly clean the Recycle Bin** in Windows; sometimes duplicate temp files hide inside PPTX archives.

## Workflow example

1. Collect imagery.
2. Batch optimize with CompressImage (WebP 75 or PNG lossless for UI).
3. Insert into PowerPoint.
4. After final edits, run Compress Pictures with “Delete cropped areas” to remove leftovers.
5. Save as PPTX (and optionally export a PDF for easy sharing).

## Conclusion

PowerPoint’s compression dialog is a useful emergency lever, but the most reliable way to manage deck size is to optimize assets before they ever reach the slides. With a combination of CompressImage, occasional Squoosh tweaks, and mindful PowerPoint settings, your presentations will travel lighter and look sharper.
