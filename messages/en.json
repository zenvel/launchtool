        "content": "In today's digital landscape, image optimization is crucial for website performance, user experience, and SEO rankings. Large, unoptimized images can significantly slow down your website, leading to higher bounce rates and lower conversion rates. Studies show that a one-second delay in page load time can result in a 7% reduction in conversions."
      },
      "formats": {
        "title": "Understanding Image Formats",
        "content": "Different image formats serve different purposes. JPEG is ideal for photographs with complex colors, PNG excels at graphics with transparency, WebP offers superior compression for both photos and graphics, and AVIF represents the cutting edge with even better compression ratios. Choosing the right format can reduce file sizes by up to 50% without visible quality loss."
      },
      "processing": {
        "title": "Client-Side vs Server-Side Processing",
        "content": "Traditional image compression tools require uploading your files to a server, which raises privacy concerns and adds latency. Client-side processing, powered by modern browser technologies like WebAssembly, keeps your data secure while delivering comparable or better performance. This approach is particularly important for sensitive images or when working with large batches of files."

      "bestPractices": {
        "title": "Best Practices for Web Images",
        "content": "To achieve optimal results, always compress images before uploading them to your website. Use responsive images with multiple sizes for different screen resolutions. Implement lazy loading to defer off-screen images. Consider using modern formats like WebP and AVIF with fallbacks for older browsers. These practices combined can reduce your page weight by 60-80% while maintaining visual quality."

      "compression": {
        "question": "How does the compression work?",
        "answer": "All compression happens locally in your browser using advanced algorithms. Your images never leave your device, ensuring complete privacy."
      },
      "formats": {
        "question": "What image formats are supported?",
        "answer": "We support all major image formats, including JPG, PNG, WebP, and the next-generation AVIF format. You can also convert between formats while optimizing."
      },
      "fileSize": {
        "question": "Is there a file size limit?",
        "answer": "No! Since all processing happens in your browser, there are no artificial file size limits. However, please note that very large files (e.g., over 30MB) may take longer to process depending on your computer's performance."
      },
      "batch": {
        "question": "Can I compress multiple images at once?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can upload and process multiple images simultaneously on our free plan. For advanced batch processing features and higher throughput, consider our upcoming Pro plan."
      },
      "quality": {
        "question": "Will compression reduce image quality?",
        "answer": "You have full control over the compression level via the quality slider. Higher compression reduces the file size but may affect quality. We recommend using our live visual comparison slider to find the ideal balance for your needs."
      },
      "free": {
        "question": "Is CompressImage really free?",
        "answer": "Yes, the core features of CompressImage are completely free for everyone. We have generous limits for everyday use. In the future, we will introduce an optional Pro plan for users with heavy-duty professional needs."
      },
