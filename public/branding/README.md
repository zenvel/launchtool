# Branding Assets

Place the final logo files for CompressImage in this directory so that the application can reference them consistently.

Current set:

- `logo-dark.png` – full logo lockup with dark backdrop (used in header)
- `logo-light.png` – inverse version for light or neutral backgrounds
- `og-default.png` – 1200×630 (or larger) social preview image referenced in metadata

If additional formats are exported (SVG, WebP, etc.), keep them alongside these files so the app can load them via `/branding/...` paths.
